Hidden Cascade Project

A Hidden cascade is an information cascade, such as Independent Cascade, Linear Threshold, or other, model in which the 
states of the cascading nodes are not directly observable, but instead have an emission distribution based on the state of the vertex. 

This Project is called Careless Whispers, in reference to illicit information propagation in a network. 

We will find you.
